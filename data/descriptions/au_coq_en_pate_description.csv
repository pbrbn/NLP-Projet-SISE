Nom,Description
Au Coq En Pâte,"The Coq en pâte is first of all a story of friendships. Céline and I, always accompanied by our friend and Chef Sylvain, have been working together for almost 20 years, for you, with pleasure. Our small team is faithfully supported by Jacques, who everyone knows as the “Colonel”. It is the memory of the house. Vivien, armed with her youth and her dynamism, joined us in the henhouse and shares her good mood! We wanted our house to be a place of relaxation and exchanges, so that every day, through a coffee, a lunch or a drink, you have a good time of conviviality. Soon to welcome you to our home ! Etienne"
